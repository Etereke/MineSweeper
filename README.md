# MineSweeper

I'm basically using this readme as notes to myself and to-do list

Changes to previous:
    -added CommandMineSweeper class + interface

Things to first address:
  -implement no-mine start
    -will need a separate init method for that probably, mines only initialize after the first input from user!
  -clean up commandminesweeper class and test some more, add comments!
  -add game with menu
  -later implement cursor version (probably not tomorrow)
